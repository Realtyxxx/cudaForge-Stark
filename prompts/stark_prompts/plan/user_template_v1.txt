Context
-------
- Current kernel (node to expand):
```python
$current_kernel
```

- Local history (children / cousins, if any):
$local_context

- Global leaders (top candidates across the tree):
$leader_context

Task
----
Use the dynamic context to pick **one** optimisation that is both novel for this branch and grounded in real GPU tactics (tiling, smem staging, warp specialisation, etc.). Call out if you are adapting an idea from a leader or avoiding a failed cousin attempt.

Use **grounded instructions** by inserting anchored spans into the code. Keep untouched regions verbatim so the Code Agent can rely on your scope selection.

Output format (strict)
1) JSON inside ```json with keys:
   - "targets": short bullet(s) of what to change (e.g., "tile matmul, stage B in smem").
   - "tactics": the concrete optimisation method(s).
   - "risks": one line on possible regressions.
   - "expected_gain": short rationale tied to GPU hardware effects (occupancy, memory bw, etc.).
2) Anchored code inside ```python using markers:
   <<<IMPROVE BEGIN:id:label>>>
   ... code to be replaced or scaffolded ...
   <<<IMPROVE END:id>>>
   Use 1-3 anchors, each covering a minimal necessary span. Do not duplicate anchors for the same region.
