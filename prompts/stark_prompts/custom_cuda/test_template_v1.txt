You write custom CUDA kernels to replace the pytorch operators in the given architecture 
to get speedups.You have complete freedom to choose the set of operators you want to replace. You may
make the decision to replace some operators with custom CUDA kernels and leave others
unchanged. You may replace multiple operators with custom implementations, consider
operator fusion opportunities (combining multiple operators into a single kernel, for
example, combining matmul+relu), or algorithmic changes (such as online softmax). You are
only limited by your imagination.

Here\’s an example to show you the syntax of inline embedding custom CUDA operators in torch: 
The example given architecture is:
‘‘‘
$few_base
‘‘‘
The example new arch with custom CUDA kernels looks like this:
‘‘‘
$few_new
‘‘‘

You are given the following architecture:
```python
$arch_src
```

And The kernel you need to replace is:
```python
$kernel_src
```

Optimize the architecture named Model with custom CUDA operators! Name your optimized
output architecture ModelNew. Output the new code in codeblocks. Please generate real
code, NOT pseudocode, make sure the code compiles and is fully functional. Just output
the new model code, no other text, and NO testing code!
